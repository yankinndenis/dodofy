In order to get rights for an already ready API, you need:
•	install the Google Client Library (apiclient) using composer:
composer require google/apiclient
 “composer install --ignore-platform-reqs”
•	Download the test.php file to the root
•	Than need to refresh credentials.json here https://console.developers.google.com/
Web client (auto created by Google Service)

 
•	Than need to download credentials.json 

 
•	Then move it to the root directory and name it "credentials.json"
•	Open test.php in the console then copy the link and open in your browser.
•	Allow any access and and copy the code from the url.
 
•	Add code to the console
 

•	Now you can transfer credentials.json and token.json to the plugin

That’s all! You have updated your access.
